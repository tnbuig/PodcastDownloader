I tried to keep the the application in general and the UX in particular simple and self explanatory as possible.

I feel that today UI should be inviting - easy to remember and fun to learn.
the first time might take few second till things will clear out but from the second time the user will be completly comfterball knowing that there isnâ€™t any hidden configuration or parts of the application that he missed.

The application tries to solve one problem only but to do it well - and I hope the user will share that feeling.

![Application Performance](/Perfromance_5030_From_15_Feeds_In_35_Seconds.png)
As you can see - test run for Scan 13 Rss Feeds and storing in Data base the data for 5030 episodes including publish Date and Download link.
the timing was 35 seconds which most of it spent on reading from the internet and depend on your internet speed.
